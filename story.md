# Plan for the story:

Scene: High school (College for the british folk)

## Story overview:

School gets SWATed because there is a bomber in the school

Additional criteria: If anyone says "roll of the dice" they blow up (with bad greenscreen exlosion and vine boom and other characters face become smol)
- Every chapter have a small chance for a character to appear in the background and say "roll of the dice" and then blow up
- Then the face of the characters in the foreground become really smol like the guy from prison school
- Then they become normal again and they go back to talking like nothing happened
- Then later at the 7th scene of the chapter where the guy blew up someone asks where they guy is
- The characters respond that "he said the thing" and blew up
- This will signify to the player that this is a part of the game universe where people say "roll of the dice" and blow up randomly

Different endings (decided by the roll of a die, you can chose to override the roll to get the secret endings):
- __Bomb ending__: bomb blows up and everyone gets killed
- __Neutral ending__: bomb gets neutralised but few classmates die along the way
- __Good ending__: everyone is saved and you go to the local 711 to get onigiri but -the guy- has a higher chance of blowing up 
- __Perfect ending__: if -the guy- doesn't blow up and everyone survives, you get the perfect ending where everyone is happy
- __Scary ending__: (triggered by an addional random event): you get teleported to the void where the game pretends to lag and you have to restart
- __Genocide ending__: everyone survives but the player choses to go for the bad ending and slaughter all their friends

- __Secret ending__: bomb doesn't blow up but everyone finds out you're from another universe (the real world) and kill you
- __Secret ending 2__: bomb blows up but you are lucky so you get away with your love interest and then she kills you

## Characters (everyone has dice for their heads):
- Player: You
- Girl 1: Childhood best friend and yandere love interest
- Boy 1: Loser boy childhood bestfriend who everyone thinks is most likely to be the bomber but is actually good, has 0% chance to be bomber
- Chad: chad
- Among us: looks like amogus
- -the guy-: Has a random chance of saying "roll of the dice" at any chapter in the story and blowing up
- Bomber: Can be any one of the students, decided randomly
